## Replicator and his little friends
Replicator crawls out from where it was started, it copies itself and milk.script to any targets

After Replicator has spread to all targets it spawns milk.

Milk tests the money and security ratios and decides if its server needs to weaken or grow.

If both are optimal it hacks.

When grow or weaken are called, it asks "home" to perform these with its large amount of RAM.

You just need to tune the threads for those in milk so they don't overwhelm your machine.

That can be hard to manage automatically with a varied number of requests, I'm working on that.

Like a NAVY SEAL Team calling in a heavy strike from an AC-130 Gunship. 

"baby bird to nest, baby bird to nest."

"Nest here, over."

"Bring the rain!"

:)

Note:

Once it really gets rolling, the money flows very nicely.

This is after overnight:

Total online production of Active scripts:$24.939m / sec

Total online production since last Aug installation:$206.422b($1.356m / sec)
