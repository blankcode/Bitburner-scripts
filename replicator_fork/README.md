## Replicator and his little friends
Replicator crawls out from where it was started, it copies itself and milk.script to any targets
After Replicator has spread to all targets it spawns milk.
Milk tests the money and security ratios and decides if it's sever needs to weaken or grow.
If both are optimal it hacks.
When grow or weaken are called, it asks "home" to performs these with its large amount of RAM.
You just need to tune the theads for those in milk so they don't overwhelm your machine.
That can be hard to manage automatically with a varied number of requests, I'm working on that.
