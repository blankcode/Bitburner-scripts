## Local Attacks
These are meant to run on a machine locally. Typically in the early game you'll be scping these to the target hosts like "foodnstuff".

On home: `run ownit.script foodnstuff`

On Target(s): `run h.script -t #Threads <Target_Host>`

The target host can be the local machine or a nearby machine.
