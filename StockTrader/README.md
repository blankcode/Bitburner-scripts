## Stock Trader
You should have heard me when I got the brokers to spawn right AND they were buying stocks!!

I couldn't find a stock trading script that I like/worked.

So I made the ultimate Stock Trader I could imagine.

"`brokermanager.script`" Spawns a "`broker.script`" for each stock.

"`broker.script`" Handles Monitoring and Buy/Sell of just one Stock.

"`sellall.script`" Fires the brokers and sells all stock.

In all it needs a server with 512 GB RAM but, each stock gets personalized attention.

It's not looking for a specific amount of gains or anything. If a stock is good enough to buy, it does, and it rides that rise until the forecast changes to a minus.

If anyone else wants to test it for me, please do.
